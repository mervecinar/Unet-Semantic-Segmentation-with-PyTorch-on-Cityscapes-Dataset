# Unet-Semantic-Segmentation-with-PyTorch-on-Cityscapes-Dataset
This GitHub repository showcases my work on semantic segmentation using a Unet model with an encoder-decoder architecture, specifically tailored for the Cityscapes dataset. Semantic segmentation involves classifying each pixel in an image, and the Unet model is known for its effectiveness in this task. <br>

Key Features:<br>

Dataset: The Cityscapes dataset, a widely used benchmark for urban scene understanding, comprising high-quality images with pixel-level annotations for various classes.<br>

Model Architecture: An encoder-decoder Unet model designed for multiclass semantic segmentation. The encoder captures high-level features, while the decoder generates segmented output maps.<br>

Implementation: PyTorch was utilized for the implementation, providing a flexible and efficient deep learning framework.
