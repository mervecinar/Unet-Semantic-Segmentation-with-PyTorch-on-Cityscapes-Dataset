# Unet-Semantic-Segmentation-with-PyTorch-on-Cityscapes-Dataset
This GitHub repository showcases my work on semantic segmentation using a Unet model with an encoder-decoder architecture, specifically tailored for the Cityscapes dataset. Semantic segmentation involves classifying each pixel in an image, and the Unet model is known for its effectiveness in this task.
